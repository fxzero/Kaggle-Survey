## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How to learn to be a better data scientist?
2. How do Data Scientists Learn?
3. What Skills do Data Scientists Need?
4. What do Data Scientists Spend TheirÂ Time?

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fxzero/how-do-you-become-a-good-data-scientist-c2473e688557).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
